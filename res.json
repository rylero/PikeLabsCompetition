  "factuality": 4.5,
  "factuality-description": "The article from NPR accurately reports on the IMF's revised global growth forecasts, citing specific figures such as a downgrade from 3.3% to 2.8% for global growth and from 2.8% to 1.8% for U.S. growth, which aligns with publicly available IMF reports and statements from their chief economist, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas. Key phrases like 'the IMF predicted the global economy would grow 2.8% this year' and 'the surge in policy uncertainty is a major driver' are directly supported by IMF documentation, making the core facts verifiable and based on a credible, non-partisan source. Other articles from diverse outlets, including Reuters and BBC, have reached similar conclusions about the IMF's warnings, even if some conservative sources like the Wall Street Journal have echoed the data while offering differing interpretations. For instance, a Wall Street Journal piece also referenced the IMF's forecast cuts, demonstrating cross-ideological agreement on the basic facts. However, the score is not a perfect 5 because while the article includes external sources like IMF statements, it does not deeply scrutinize potential counterarguments or alternative economic analyses that might downplay tariff impacts, such as those from U.S.-centric think tanks. Overall, the reporting sticks to cold hard facts without apparent fabrication, but factuality is slightly tempered by the potential for selective emphasis on negative outcomes.",
  "bias": -1,
  "bias-description": "The article exhibits a slight left-leaning bias (-1 on the scale), as NPR is known for its progressive-leaning coverage, and the phrasing, such as 'fears are rising that foreign investors may be cutting their exposure' and emphasis on 'an all-out trade war,' subtly frames Trump's policies in a critical light without overt editorializing. Key sentences like 'Global markets have tumbled in the wake of Trump's latest tariffs' suggest a focus on risks and uncertainties, which aligns with left-leaning narratives that often highlight potential downsides of protectionist policies. However, the bias is not extreme, as the article relies on neutral IMF data and avoids inflammatory language, maintaining a factual tone that could appear in center-right outlets as well.",
