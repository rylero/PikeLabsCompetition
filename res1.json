  "factuality-description": "The article scores a 4 out of 5 for factuality due to its reliance on verifiable data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), such as the specific global growth forecast of 2.8% for this year (down from 3.3% in 2024) and the U.S. growth forecast of 1.8% (down from 2.8%). It also quotes IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas directly, adding credibility. However, some claims, like 'global markets have tumbled in the wake of Trump's latest tariffs,' lack specific data or evidence to support the extent of the market reaction, which prevents a perfect score.",
  "bias": -1,
  "bias-description": "The article receives a bias score of -1, indicating a slight left-leaning perspective. This is based on the framing of Trump's tariffs as a primary threat to the global economy with phrases like 'threaten to spark an all-out trade war' and 'fears are rising that foreign investors may be cutting their exposure to the U.S.' These suggest a negative view of the policy without substantial counterarguments or positive framing of Trump's potential goals, such as protecting domestic industries. While the article does mention Trump's pause on some tariffs and negotiation efforts, the overall tone emphasizes economic risks over potential benefits.",
