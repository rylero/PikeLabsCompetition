(AP Photo/Rebecca Blackwell, File) [...] MIAMI (AP) — The roster of local police departments and state agencies that have joined President Donald Trump’s drive for mass deportations has soared to more than 500, with nearly half from Florida.
That cooperation will be on display Thursday when Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis joins officials from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to tout an operation that authorities say netted about 800 immigration arrests in less than a week. [...] Authorities targeted people who faced final deportation orders and detained others on outstanding arrest warrants for previous offenses, like driving under the influence or without a license, Smith said.
“Florida is leading the nation in active cooperation with the Trump administration for immigration enforcement and deportation operations!” DeSantis said after ICE announced arrests Saturday.

Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the legislation into law in February as part of President Donald Trump’s push to crack down on illegal immigration, though many of Trump’s immigration enforcement efforts are currently mired in battles with federal judges. [...] DeSousa also argued that the immigrant groups filing the lawsuit could have named the individual law enforcement agencies in their complaint, rather than just the Florida attorney general, the statewide prosecutor and Florida’s 20 state attorneys.
